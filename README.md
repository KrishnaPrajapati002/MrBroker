"# langchain_Financial_bot" 

This Python project is an intelligent stock analysis chatbot named **Mr.Broker**, designed to assist users with financial insights using real-time market data and AI-driven responses. Built with LangChain and Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash model, the app can analyse stock tickers extracted from user queries. It retrieves historical stock prices via the `yfinance` library, calculates the 200-day moving average (DMA), and compares it against the latest closing price to suggest whether a user should consider buying, holding, or selling the stock. The chatbot uses a structured prompt template with both system-level and user-level messages to generate accurate, contextual responses. If no ticker is provided in the question, the app still offers financial insights through LLM-powered interpretations. The program also maintains a conversation history for contextual relevance. Designed with modularity and expandability in mind, it supports robust prompt engineering and integrates dotenv for secure API key management. This makes it a practical tool for casual investors and finance enthusiasts seeking quick, AI-generated stock analysis directly from their terminal or integrated interface.
